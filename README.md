# Intel-Based-MacBook-coreboot-Research-And-Development
A repository where I will be hosting documentation and guides to install/flash open-source firmware known as "coreboot" on Apple MacBooks ranging from 2010* to 2012*. I will update this repo and my Hackaday mirror as I streamline the process to make it more accessible for the general MacBook owner.

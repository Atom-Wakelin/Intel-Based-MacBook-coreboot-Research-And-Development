<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>I am currently in the process of writing my most detailed Coreboot project log so far. I am almost done with the flashing process but need to verify my work and ensure that any instructions I share here on Hackaday are accurate and will not cause anyone to brick their computers.</p>

<p><br>The log will detail every Shell command I execute with screenshots, plus explanations of each and every function I perform. I want the documentation to be as accessible as possible, so it will be explained in a way that is simple and easy to follow.</p>

<p><br>The end goal? Create a go-to step-by-step tutorial to flash Coreboot to your MacBook without bricking it or making the same mistakes I did.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!<em><br></em></p>
